    - In the last 7 days, what country produced the majority of the traffic on the website?
      - Answer: In the last 7 days China produced the majority of the traffic on the website.
      ![Kibana-Last 7 days- Country with most traffic](https://github.com/Hermsd/Project-1-Deploying-ELK-Stack/blob/ca7e30dfa257a548156b949492d9cb13ec574dea/Images/Kibana-Last%207%20days-%20Country%20with%20most%20traffic.png)

      - Answer: Of the traffic that's coming from China, the time of day with the highest amount of activity was 3:00 PM. 
      ![Kibana-CH-Time of day with most amount of traffic](https://github.com/Hermsd/Project-1-Deploying-ELK-Stack/blob/ca7e30dfa257a548156b949492d9cb13ec574dea/Images/Kibana-CH-Time%20of%20day%20with%20most%20amount%20of%20traffic.png)   
    - List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).
      - Answer: CSS files (Cascading Style Sheets), which are files taht describe how HTML elements are displayed. DEB files, which are debbian software pakcage files and are used mainly in Unix-based operating systems.

RPM files, which are Red Hat package manager files that are used to store installation packages on Linux operating systems. Zip files, which is a common file format used to compress one or more files together in a single location. 
3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
     - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
     - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?
       - In the last 7 days the most amount of activity was on 02/27/2022 at 9:00PM and on 03/03/2022 at 3:00PM. The fact that on both those days is that on 02/27/2022 at 9:00PM there were only 3 visitors and on 03/03/2022 there were only 4 visitors, however despite having the lowest amount of visitors in the last 7 days, both of those days account for largest amount of activity.
